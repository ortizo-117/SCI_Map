   - Data must be organized in BIDS format
   - Both SCI and control cohort scans

2. **Software Requirements**
   - FreeSurfer (installed and operational)
   - Python dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

3. **Metadata Requirements**
   - Subject ID
   - Age
   - Cohort designation (SCI or Control)
   - Neuropathic pain status for SCI participants

## Data Structure

Your data should be organized following BIDS conventions: 

## Repository Purpose and Processing Pipeline

This repository serves as a centralized location for sharing processing scripts with all participating institutes in the SCI_MAP project. The standardized scripts ensure consistent analysis across different sites and datasets.

### Step 1: FreeSurfer Processing (reconall.sh)

**Note:** If you have already run FreeSurfer's recon-all on your data, you can skip this step and proceed directly to Step 2. However, ensure you have a working FreeSurfer installation as it will be required for Step 3.

The initial processing step uses the `reconall.sh` script located in the processing folder. This script can be run on:
- Linux systems
- Windows systems using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
  - Recommended: Ubuntu on WSL
  - Make sure FreeSurfer is properly installed in your WSL environment

The script:

1. Takes BIDS-formatted T1w images as input
2. Applies FreeSurfer's `recon-all` command to perform:
   - Skull stripping
   - White matter segmentation
   - Surface reconstruction
   - Cortical parcellation
   - Subcortical segmentation
3. Generates structural information for subsequent analysis

**System Requirements:**
- For Windows users: WSL installed with Ubuntu distribution
- FreeSurfer properly configured in your Linux/WSL environment
- Sufficient disk space for FreeSurfer outputs (~1GB per subject)

#### Usage
1. Open the `reconall.sh` script and update the directory paths:
   ```bash
   # Update these paths in reconall.sh
   RAWDATA_DIR="/path/to/your/bids/dataset"      # Directory containing your BIDS-formatted T1w images
   DERIVATIVES_DIR="/path/to/output/derivatives"  # Directory where FreeSurfer outputs will be saved
   ```

2. Make the script executable and run it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x processing/reconall.sh
   ./processing/reconall.sh
   ```

**Error Handling Tip:**
If you encounter script execution errors, especially when running on WSL or after editing on Windows, you may need to fix line endings using dos2unix:
```bash
# Install dos2unix if not already installed
sudo apt-get install dos2unix

# Convert the script to Unix format
dos2unix processing/reconall.sh
```
This fixes the "bad interpreter" or similar errors caused by Windows-style line endings (CRLF).

The script will:
- Process all subjects found in your BIDS directory
- Create a FreeSurfer output directory for each subject
- Generate logs in the derivatives directory

**Example Directory Structure:**
```
study/
├── rawdata/                  # Your RAWDATA_DIR
│   ├── sub-001/
│   │   └── anat/
│   │       └── sub-001_T1w.nii.gz
│   └── sub-002/
│       └── anat/
│           └── sub-002_T1w.nii.gz
└── derivatives/              # Your DERIVATIVES_DIR
    └── freesurfer/
        ├── sub-001/
        └── sub-002/
```

#### Processing Time
- Approximately 20 minutes per subject (benchmarked on NVIDIA 4070Ti)

### Step 2: Quality Assurance

Quality control of the FreeSurfer outputs is performed using the ENIGMA QA pipeline. This step uses the `enigma_fs_wrapper_script.sh` (run from WSL or Linux command terminal) which has been modified from the original ENIGMA-FreeSurfer-protocol-main to work with both Windows and Linux paths. The script must be executed in a WSL or Linux terminal environment, even when working with Windows paths.

#### Prerequisites
1. **MATLAB Requirements:**
   - MATLAB R2023a or older installed
   - Image Processing Toolbox
   - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

2. **Subject List File:**
   Create a text file (e.g., `subject_ids.txt`) containing one subject ID per line:
   ```text
   sub-001
   sub-002
   sub-003
   ```
   **Note:** Subject IDs must match the FreeSurfer output directory names

3. **FreeSurfer Outputs:**
   - Completed FreeSurfer processing for all subjects
   - Standard FreeSurfer directory structure
   - Required files:
     - `mri/orig_nu.mgz`
     - `mri/aparc+aseg.mgz`

**Important Updates:**
- Script has been modified to handle Windows/WSL and Linux paths automatically
- Path conversion has been tested with MATLAB R2023a
- MATLAB functions are compatible with both Windows and Linux environments
- Automatic path conversion between WSL and Windows formats for MATLAB calls

#### Usage Example
```bash
./enigma_fs_wrapper_script.sh \
  --subjects "/mnt/c/Users/kramerlab/Documents/freesurfer_SCI_extra_subjects/results_pybrain/subject_ids.txt" \
  --fsdir "/mnt/c/Users/kramerlab/Documents/freesurfer_SCI_extra_subjects/derivatives" \
  --outdir "/mnt/c/Users/kramerlab/Documents/freesurfer_SCI_extra_subjects/ENIGMA_outputs" \

#### Output Structure
```
ENIGMA_outputs/
├── measures/
│   ├── LandRvolumes.csv
│   ├── CorticalMeasuresENIGMA_ThickAvg.csv
│   └── CorticalMeasuresENIGMA_SurfAvg.csv
└── qc/

    ├── cortical_internal/
    │   └── ENIGMA_Cortical_QC.html
    └── cortical_external/
        └── ENIGMA_External_QC.html
```

**Note:** For Windows/WSL users, make sure to:
1. Use Windows paths for MATLAB executable
2. Use WSL paths for other arguments
3. Ensure MATLAB can access the ENIGMA_QC functions

**Quality Assessment Process:**
After generating the QC HTML files, visual inspection of the segmentations should be performed following the ENIGMA Cortical Quality Control Guide 2.0 [available here](https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-protocols/). 

Common QC Issues to Look For:

1. **Subcortical Segmentation Issues:**
   - Incorrect boundary definitions
   - Missing structures
   - Asymmetrical segmentation between hemispheres
   - Unusual shapes or volumes in subcortical structures

2. **Cortical Surface Problems:**
   - Skull strip failures (remaining dura/skull)
   - White matter segmentation errors
   - Pial surface overestimation
   - Missing gyri or sulci
   - Topological defects

3. **Motion Artifacts:**
   - Blurring or ringing in the original T1
   - Distorted segmentation due to movement
   - Inconsistent tissue boundaries

4. **Intensity Issues:**
   - Poor gray/white matter contrast
   - Intensity normalization failures
   - Bias field artifacts affecting segmentation

Follow the ENIGMA protocol guidelines to:
- Rate each scan's quality (Pass/Fail)
- Document specific issues found
- Make consistent decisions about subject exclusion
- Record QC decisions in a standardized format

Review each subject's QC HTML files thoroughly before proceeding to the next step. When in doubt, consult the detailed examples in the ENIGMA Cortical Quality Control Guide.

#### Example QC Outputs

These HTML files provide interactive views of the segmentation results for detailed quality assessment. Use them in conjunction with the ENIGMA QC guidelines to evaluate segmentation quality.

### Step 3: Data Organization for Brain Age Prediction (aparc_aseg_pybrain.sh)

After FreeSurfer processing and quality assurance, the next step involves organizing the structural data into a format compatible with PyBrain for brain age prediction analysis. 

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed FreeSurfer processing (from Step 1 or pre-existing)
- Working FreeSurfer installation (required for reading FreeSurfer outputs)
- FreeSurfer environment properly configured

This step uses the `aparc_aseg_pybrain.sh` script, which:

1. Extracts relevant metrics from FreeSurfer's aparc and aseg outputs
2. Organizes the data into a standardized format required by PyBrain
3. Generates a consolidated dataset for brain age prediction

#### Usage
1. Open the `aparc_aseg_pybrain.sh` script and update the directory paths:
   ```bash
   # Update these paths in aparc_aseg_pybrain.sh
   ROOT_DIR="/path/to/your/freesurfer/subjects"    # Directory containing FreeSurfer processed subjects
   OUTPUT_DIR="/path/to/save/pybrain/features"     # Directory where the output CSV will be saved
   ```

2. Make the script executable and run it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x processing/aparc_aseg_pybrain.sh
   ./processing/aparc_aseg_pybrain.sh
   ```

**Note:** Like the reconall.sh script, this can be run on:
- Linux systems
- Windows systems using WSL (Ubuntu recommended)

**Error Handling Tip:**
If you encounter script execution errors, fix line endings using dos2unix:
```bash
dos2unix processing/aparc_aseg_pybrain.sh
```

The script will generate a CSV file containing all the required features for brain age prediction.

### Step 4: Age Data Integration

The final preparation step involves manually adding participant age information to your dataset:

1. Open the output file from Step 3
2. Add a new column for age as the second column (right after subject ID)
3. Save the file as 'subject_features.csv' with the following structure:

subject_id,age,feature1,feature2,...

### Step 5: Brain Age Prediction

Use the `predict.py` script to generate brain age predictions for your cohort using the PyBrain model:

#### Required Path Configuration
Before running the prediction script, you need to modify the following paths in `predict.py`:

1. `age_data_path`: Path to your subject_features.csv file
   ```python
   age_data_path = "/path/to/your/subject_features.csv"
   ```

2. `model_path`: Path to the ExtraTreesModel file
   ```python
   model_path = "/path/to/PyBrainAge-main/software/ExtraTreesModel"
   ```

3. `scaler_path`: Path to the scaler.pkl file
   ```python
   scaler_path = "/path/to/PyBrainAge-main/software/scaler.pkl"
   ```

**Important Note:** Due to file size limitations, the ExtraTreesModel and scaler files are not directly stored in this repository. To obtain these files:

1. Download them from the original PyBrain repository:
   - Visit https://github.com/james-cole/PyBrainAge
   - Navigate to the software directory
   - Download ExtraTreesModel and scaler.pkl files

2. Place the files in your local SCI_MAP directory:
   ```
   SCI_MAP/
   └── PyBrainAge-main/
       └── software/
           ├── ExtraTreesModel
           └── scaler.pkl
   ```

3. Update the paths in your predict.py script accordingly

**Python Environment Setup:**
The ExtraTreesModel and scaler.pkl files were built using specific Python dependencies. To ensure compatibility:

1. Create a new conda environment following PyBrain's requirements:
   ```bash
   conda create  --name pybrainage_env python=3.7 scikit-learn=0.24.2 pandas=1.3.4 numpy=1.20.3
   conda activate pybrainage_env 
   ```


2. Install the required dependencies as specified in the PyBrain repository:
   - Follow the installation steps at https://github.com/james-cole/PyBrainAge
   - This ensures correct versions of scikit-learn, pandas, and other dependencies

**Note:** Using different Python versions or package versions may cause compatibility issues when loading the model and scaler files.
