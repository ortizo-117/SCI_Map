line 82: results -> create a new dataframe to store your results. Make sure to include the analysis name in the name e.g. PvH_results 
line 82: dataframe -> List the name to the dataframe for the specific analysis being ran e.g. SCI_PvH
line 82: 5 -> you may need to change this number based on your own dataframe, this states that analysis begins on column 5. If your data starts earlier or later, you'll need to change this.
